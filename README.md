# Heart Dataset Project

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of the Heart dataset to gain insights into factors affecting heart health. The dataset contains various attributes related to individuals' health, and the project covers data exploration, visualization, and building machine learning models for heart disease prediction.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Explored the basic structure of the dataset using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values using `msno.bar()` and other relevant techniques.
- Removed duplicate records from the dataset.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Utilized various plots and visualizations to understand the distribution of numerical and categorical features.
- Explored relationships between different variables.

### 4. Feature Analysis

- Conducted analysis on specific columns like age, sex, chest pain, etc.
- Visualized distributions and unique values.

### 5. Data Visualization

- Created visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots to understand the data better.
- Analyzed relationships between different variables.

### 6. Correlation Analysis

- Calculated and visualized the correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.

### 7. Data Preprocessing

- Prepared the data for machine learning models.
- Scaled and encoded features as necessary.

### 8. Model Building

- Implemented multiple machine learning models for heart disease prediction.
- Models include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine.

### 9. Model Evaluation

- Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest using GridSearchCV.

### 10. Final Model and Recommendations

- Selected the best-performing model.
- Provided recommendations or insights based on the analysis.

## Conclusion

In summary, this project aims to analyze the Heart dataset, preprocess the data, build machine learning models, and provide insights into factors influencing heart health.

# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project revolves around a comprehensive analysis of sentiments expressed on Twitter, offering a deep dive into the emotional landscape of user-generated content. Leveraging Python, AI, and machine learning, the project encompasses diverse methodologies, from data acquisition to sentiment visualization, and advanced topic modeling.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Acquisition

- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Explored the basic structure of the dataset using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- Removed duplicate records from the dataset.

### 3. Results Visualization

- Utilized Matplotlib to present sentiment distributions, trends over time, and user engagement insights.
- Explored anomaly detection techniques to identify deviations from regular user behavior.

### 4. Topic Modeling

- Delved into advanced techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, unveiling latent themes within tweets.

### 5. User Engagement and Sentiment Analysis

- Explored user engagement through average likes, retweets, and sentiment analysis per sentiment category.
- Conducted sentiment analysis over time to understand evolving trends.
  
### 6. User and Tweet Analysis

- Investigated user sentiments based on the first letter of the username.
- Analyzed most liked and retweeted tweets for additional insights.

### 7. Word Embeddings

- Tokenized text data and trained a Word2Vec model.
- Visualized word embeddings using t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.
  
### 8. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- Applied spaCy's English NER model to extract entities from tweets.

### 9. Emotion Detection

- Utilized VADER sentiment analysis for emotion detection in tweets.
  
### 10. Data Classification

- Prepared data for classification, implementing TF-IDF for feature extraction.
- Trained and evaluated a classification model (Naive Bayes) for sentiment prediction.
  
## Conclusion

In conclusion, this Twitter sentiment analysis project provides a comprehensive exploration of sentiments expressed on the platform, offering valuable insights for researchers, marketers, and individuals interested in understanding the dynamics of social media discourse.
